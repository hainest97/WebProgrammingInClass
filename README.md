For as long as I can remember math was always my best subject, and even to this day but especially when I was younger I really enjoyed building and creating things with my LEGOs. Interestingly enough, my favorite math class in high school was geometry. Also at my high school, there was a program called the Academy of Information Technology, which as the name suggests would offer classes that taught students about the various areas of information technology. Through the academy, I took a programming class where I built my first computer programs in Python, including a slot machine. It was the best class I ever took in high school and I really wanted to learn more. So that's when I chose my major of computer science, because it combined my interest in building things with math and logic, which I already had interest for all my life up until that point, and thus felt like something I would be passionate about for a career. Last semester (spring of 2021), I was involved in creating a make-up simulator where my job was to keep track of all products in a database while also implementing software that would recognize faces from a video camera in real time and put products on detected faces.
There are a lot of things that I can use this course for. Obviously I intend on using this class to meet the prerequisites for projects here at New Paltz. But Iâ€™m also hoping that I can use this class to create my own websites. One example is that my sister is looking to make a website. She is a vocal performer and is looking to make a website that she can show to agents. I feel I can obtain the necessary skills to create this website for her. Regardless, I cannot conceive that what I learn in this class will not be useful in other areas as well.
